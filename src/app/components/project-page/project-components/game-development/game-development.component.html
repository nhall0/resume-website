                I have participated in a number of game jams, all hosted on my itch.io - see the links here and on the home page to go check it out! Before working on game jam games, most projects I worked
                on ended quickly and unfinished. Game jams provide a tight deadline and a theme - both did a lot to help me get something complete done. Most if not all assets were created by me, including art and music.
                For dessert - I've included some of my first Python projects from 2010.

            This is my latest game jam - I learned a lot from my first go in the Summer Jam. By far the trickiest part of any of these is figuring out what to do, then sticking with it.
            Implementation is the easiest part, followed by asset creation. Originally the game was going to about destroying mechs and recycling them for parts, then creating contraptions
            to defend against the next wave with said parts. I ended up just making a tower defense game with a mech theme. I think I could have done more.

            This was my first game jam - lots of fun. It's a simple game about breaking apart asteroids in space. Originally, it was supposed to be similar to agar.io - you'd break apart asteroids
            by gaining speed - and you'd become part of the larger broken parts. I ended up with something close to my vision, but I think I could have done more. It's a bit buggy but I'm fine with the 
            result.

            I started learning Python in 2010, check out some of my first projects below. Somehow I've kept them around all these years.
